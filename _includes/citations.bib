              Objective
              . Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive optical technique used to measure arterial oxygen saturation (SpO
              2
              ) in a variety of clinical settings and scenarios. Despite being one the most significant technological advances in health monitoring over the last few decades, there have been reports on its various limitations. Recently due to the Covid-19 pandemic, questions about pulse oximeter technology and its accuracy when used in people with different skin pigmentation have resurfaced, and are to be addressed.
              Approach
              . This review presents an introduction to the technique of pulse oximetry including its basic principle of operation, technology, and limitations, with a more in depth focus on skin pigmentation. Relevant literature relating to the performance and accuracy of pulse oximeters in populations with different skin pigmentation are evaluated.
              Main Results
              . The majority of the evidence suggests that the accuracy of pulse oximetry differs in subjects of different skin pigmentations to a level that requires particular attention, with decreased accuracy in patients with dark skin.
              Significance
              . Some recommendations, both from the literature and contributions from the authors, suggest how future work could address these inaccuracies to potentially improve clinical outcomes. These include the objective quantification of skin pigmentation to replace currently used qualitative methods, and computational modelling for predicting calibration algorithms based on skin colour.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            As wearable technologies are being increasingly used for clinical research and healthcare, it is critical to understand their accuracy and determine how measurement errors may affect research conclusions and impact healthcare decision-making. Accuracy of wearable technologies has been a hotly debated topic in both the research and popular science literature. Currently, wearable technology companies are responsible for assessing and reporting the accuracy of their products, but little information about the evaluation method is made publicly available. Heart rate measurements from wearables are derived from photoplethysmography (PPG), an optical method for measuring changes in blood volume under the skin. Potential inaccuracies in PPG stem from three major areas, includes (1) diverse skin types, (2) motion artifacts, and (3) signal crossover. To date, no study has systematically explored the accuracy of wearables across the full range of skin tones. Here, we explored heart rate and PPG data from consumer- and research-grade wearables under multiple circumstances to test whether and to what extent these inaccuracies exist. We saw no statistically significant difference in accuracy across skin tones, but we saw significant differences between devices, and between activity types, notably, that absolute error during activity was, on average, 30\% higher than during rest. Our conclusions indicate that different wearables are all reasonably accurate at resting and prolonged elevated heart rate, but that differences exist between devices in responding to changes in activity. This has implications for researchers, clinicians, and consumers in drawing study conclusions, combining study results, and making health-related decisions using these devices.},

Given the ability of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to provide insights into the microvascular bed and their compatibility with wearable devices, significant research has focused on using PPG signals for blood pressure estimation. This study aimed to identify specific clinical PPG features that vary with different blood pressure levels. Through a literature review of 297 publications, we selected 16 relevant studies and identified key time-dependent PPG features associated with blood pressure prediction. Our analysis highlighted the second derivative of PPG signals, particularly the b/a and d/a ratios, as the most frequently reported and significant predictors of systolic blood pressure. Additionally, features from the velocity and acceleration photoplethysmograms were also notable. In total, 29 features were analyzed, revealing novel temporal domain features that show promise for further research and application in blood pressure estimation.},

            Blood Pressure (BP) is an important cardiovascular health indicator. BP is usually monitored non-invasively with a cuff-based device, which can be bulky and inconvenient. Thus, continuous and portable BP monitoring devices, such as those based on a photoplethysmography (PPG) waveform, are desirable. In particular, Machine Learning (ML) based BP estimation approaches have gained considerable attention as they have the potential to estimate intermittent or continuous BP with only a single PPG measurement. Over the last few years, many ML-based BP estimation approaches have been proposed with no agreement on their modeling methodology. To ease the model comparison, we designed a benchmark with four open datasets with shared preprocessing, the right validation strategy avoiding information shift and leak, and standard evaluation metrics. We also adapted Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) to improve the interpretability of model evaluation, especially across different BP datasets. The proposed benchmark comes with open datasets and codes. We showcase its effectiveness by comparing 11 ML-based approaches of three different categories.},

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a highly promising device due to its advantages in portability, user-friendly operation, and non-invasive capabilities to measure a wide range of physiological information. Recent advancements in deep learning have demonstrated remarkable outcomes by leveraging PPG signals for tasks related to personal health management and other multifaceted applications. In this review, we systematically reviewed papers that applied deep learning models to process PPG data between January 1st of 2017 and July 31st of 2023 from Google Scholar, PubMed and Dimensions. Each paper is analyzed from three key perspectives: tasks, models, and data. We finally extracted 193 papers where different deep learning frameworks were used to process PPG signals. Based on the tasks addressed in these papers, we categorized them into two major groups: medical-related, and non-medical-related. The medical-related tasks were further divided into seven subgroups, including blood pressure analysis, cardiovascular monitoring and diagnosis, sleep health, mental health, respiratory monitoring and analysis, blood glucose analysis, as well as others. The non-medical-related tasks were divided into four subgroups, which encompass signal processing, biometric identification, electrocardiogram reconstruction, and human activity recognition. In conclusion, significant progress has been made in the field of using deep learning methods to process PPG data recently. This allows for a more thorough exploration and utilization of the information contained in PPG signals. However, challenges remain, such as limited quantity and quality of publicly available databases, a lack of effective validation in real-world scenarios, and concerns about the interpretability, scalability, and complexity of deep learning models. Moreover, there are still emerging research areas that require further investigation.},

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical method to acquire various vital signs, including heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). The PPG method is highly susceptible to motion artifacts and environmental noise. Unfortunately, such artifacts are inevitable in ubiquitous health monitoring, as the users are involved in various activities in their daily routines. Such low-quality PPG signals negatively impact the accuracy of the extracted health parameters, leading to inaccurate decision-making. PPG-based health monitoring necessitates a quality assessment approach to determine the signal quality according to the accuracy of the health parameters. Different studies have thus far introduced PPG signal quality assessment methods, exploiting various indicators and machine learning algorithms. These methods differentiate reliable and unreliable signals, considering morphological features of the PPG signal and focusing on the cardiac cycles. Therefore, they can be utilized for HR detection applications. However, they do not apply to HRV, as only having an acceptable shape is insufficient, and other signal factors may also affect the accuracy. In this article, we propose a deep learning–based PPG quality assessment method for HR and various HRV parameters. We employ one customized one-dimensional (1D) and three 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train models for each parameter. Reliability of each of these parameters will be evaluated against the corresponding electrocardiogram signal, using 210 hours of data collected from a home-based health monitoring application. Our results show that the proposed 1D CNN method outperforms the other 2D CNN approaches. Our 1D CNN model obtains the accuracy of 95.63\%, 96.71\%, 91.42\%, 94.01\%, and 94.81\% for the HR, average of normal to normal interbeat (NN) intervals, root mean square of successive NN interval differences, standard deviation of NN intervals, and ratio of absolute power in low frequency to absolute power in high frequency ratios, respectively. Moreover, we compare the performance of our proposed method with state-of-the-art algorithms. We compare our best models for HR-HRV health parameters with six different state-of-the-art PPG signal quality assessment methods. Our results indicate that the proposed method performs better than the other methods. We also provide the open source model implemented in Python for the community to be integrated into their solutions.},

            Pulse oximetry enables real-time, noninvasive monitoring of arterial blood oxygen levels. However, results can vary with skin color, thus detecting disparities during clinical validation studies requires an accurate measure of skin pigmentation. Recent clinical studies have used subjective methods such as self-reported color, race/ethnicity to categorize skin. Melanometers based on optical reflectance may offer a more effective, objective approach to assess pigmentation. Here, we review melanometry approaches and assess evidence supporting their use as clinical research tools. We compare performance data, including repeatability, robustness to confounders, and compare devices to each other, to subjective methods, and high-quality references. Finally, we propose best practices for evaluating melanometers and discuss alternate optical approaches that may improve accuracy. Whilst evidence indicates that melanometers can provide superior performance to subjective approaches, we encourage additional research and standardization efforts, as these are needed to ensure consistent and reliable results in clinical studies.},

PPG signal's second derivative wave contains important health-related information. Thus, analysis of this waveform can help researchers and clinicians to evaluate various cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Moreover, investigating the second derivative wave of PPG signal can also assist in early detection and diagnosis of various cardiovascular illnesses that may possibly appear later in life. For early recognition and analysis of such illnesses, continuous and real-time monitoring is an important approach that has been enabled by the latest technological advances in sensor technology and wireless communications.

	abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an easy and convenient method by which to measure heart rate (HR). However, PPG signals that optically measure volumetric changes in blood are not robust to motion artifacts. In this paper, we develop a PPG measuring system based on multi-channel sensors with multiple wavelengths and propose a motion artifact reduction algorithm using independent component analysis (ICA). We also propose a truncated singular value decomposition for 12-channel PPG signals, which contain direction and depth information measured using the developed multi-channel PPG measurement system. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated against the R-peaks of an electrocardiogram in terms of sensitivity (Se), positive predictive value (PPV), and failed detection rate (FDR). The experimental results show that Se, PPV, and FDR were 99\%, 99.55\%, and 0.45\% for walking, 96.28\%, 99.24\%, and 0.77\% for fast walking, and 82.49\%, 99.83\%, and 0.17\% for running, respectively. The evaluation shows that the proposed method is effective in reducing errors in HR estimation from PPG signals with motion artifacts in intensive motion situations such as fast walking and running.},
