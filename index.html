          <p>I'm currently pursuing a master's in Computer Science at Northwestern University, where I graduated with my Bachelor
            of Arts in Computer Science in 2024. I've been able to use my master's to explore the field of machine learning,
            where I've become interested in the use of reinforcement learning for preference alignment of LLMs as a student of Professor <a href="https://bstadie.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradly Stadie</a> and the use
            of techniques like transfer learning and data augmentation to boost model performance under Professor <a href="https://zachwd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zach Wood-Doughty</a>.</p>
          <p> I previously worked with the <a href="https://eipcm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Institute for Participatory Media</a>
            developing <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/rock_paper_scissors/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tools</a>
             to empower students towards intelligent engagement with AI tools. 
          </p>
          <p>Feel free to <a href="mailto:nwsowder@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">email</a> me if you have any questions or suggestions!</p>
