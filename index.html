          <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a graduate student in computer science at Northwestern University.</p>
          <p>My academic and professional interests center around the fascinating 
            intersection of machine learning and human cognition. I'm passionate about exploring 
            how technology can enhance learning, streamline decision-making, and ultimately help 
            people achieve their goals more effectively.</p>
          <p>This portfolio showcases some of my workâ€”feel free to explore, and don't hesitate 
            to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect!</p>
