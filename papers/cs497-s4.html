<p>In this study, we investigate the relationship between skin
pigmentation and photoplethysmography (PPG) signal quality by analyzing
different wavelength combinations in controlled laboratory conditions.
Identifying optimal wavelengths based on skin pigmentation can
significantly enhance the accuracy of PPG measurements on wearable
devices, such as smartwatches. By calibrating devices to account for the
user’s skin tone, measurement errors may be reduced, particularly
addressing the disparity in measurement quality often experienced
between lighter and darker skin tones. Given that most wearable devices
currently perform better on individuals with lighter skin, as
highlighted by prior research <span class="citation"
data-cites="bent_investigating_2020"></span>, we hope to expand upon
past literature in this area to increase accessibility and reduce bias
in healthcare outcomes.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Photoplethysmography (PPG) has gained popularity as a non-invasive
method of measuring heart rate in patients. Furthermore, PPG has
recently seen novel applications in measuring patient blood pressure
<span class="citation"
data-cites="elgendi_photoplethysmography_2024"></span> in a similar
non-invasive manner, without the need for mechanical cuffs. However, PPG
can be prone to noisy signals, because the light refractions it detects
can vary with the environment and the individual <span class="citation"
data-cites="castaneda_review_2018"></span>. In fact, recent literature
suggests that skin pigmentation can affect the reading quality of PPG
<span class="citation" data-cites="al-halawani_review_2023"></span>, and
that the light wavelength used by the PPG device can also affect the
reading quality <span class="citation"
data-cites="fallow_influence_2013"></span>. However, studies that have
explored the effect of skin pigmentation on the quality of PPG used
dated and subjective measurements of skin tone. These skin tone
classifications are prone to errors due to observer bias, lighting
conditions, and bias in self-reporting <span class="citation"
data-cites="vasudevan_melanometry_2024"></span>. This poses a problem
for the measurement quality of PPG sensing for people of different skin
tones. We focus on evaluating the most effective wavelength or
combination of wavelengths for people of different skin tones and
providing more information on the effect of skin pigmentation on PPG
reading. To improve on previous research, we propose using measuring
tools such as colorimeters to ensure a more robust categorization of
skin pigmentation. Specifically, we used a colorimeter that expresses
color in the CIELAB color space defined by the International Commission
on Illumination. This measurement tool and metric provides a more
reliable measurement of skin tone due to the CIELAB color space being
designed to represent human color perception and providing an objective
quantification of skin pigmentation that is independent of observer bias
<span class="citation" data-cites="ly_research_2020"></span>. We also
expand on the current literature by increasing the types of wavelengths
that have been tested, including intermediate visible and infrared
wavelengths.</p>
<p>Our study was performed by recruiting participants of a variety of
skin tones and measuring their skin pigmentation in a fluorescent-lit
room at room temperature to ensure consistent lighting and temperature
conditions. We used ExtHub, a wearable device that includes red, orange,
green, and infrared wavelengths to collect PPG on the participants. The
device was worn on the participant’s right wrist, and data was collected
for each wavelength while the participant is sitting at rest. We
preprocessed the raw PPG data and utilized statistical evaluation
techniques to assess the quality of the PPG signal. We used the signal
quality metrics to split PPG readings into "good" and "bad" quality
readings. We analyzed the frequency of good and bad quality PPG signals
across the varied wavelengths for each categorized skin tone in order to
determine whether there existed a correlation between skin tone and PPG
reading, and what role wavelength played upon this correlation (if
any).</p>
<h1 id="related-works">Related Works</h1>
<p>Current PPG sensors utilize one or more light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
to capture the intensity of non-absorbed light reflected from the tissue
<span class="citation" data-cites="castaneda_review_2018"></span>. The
most prevalent LED colors are green, red, and yellow, with red being the
longest wavelength and green being the shortest wavelength of the three.
Studies have determined that light with longer wavelengths will
penetrate deeper into the tissue compared to light with shorter
wavelengths <span class="citation"
data-cites="fallow_influence_2013"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="setchfield_effect_2024"></span>. However, the range of
electromagnetic wavelengths have historically been quite limited.
Studies which include PPG sensor light wavelength variability have only
tested within the range of visible light <span class="citation"
data-cites="al-halawani_review_2023"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="fallow_influence_2013"></span>. We seek to expand the
current literature by testing on infrared light in addition to visible
light, and use combinations of wavelengths as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, researchers have found that darker skin tones were
correlated with lower accuracy in biological markers derived from PPG
signals <span class="citation"
data-cites="al-halawani_review_2023"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="bent_investigating_2020"></span>. To account for this,
previous studies have categorized skin pigmentation on scales such as
the Fitzpatrick skin type scale (FST) and measured absorption and
scattering coefficients with varying wavelengths <span class="citation"
data-cites="setchfield_effect_2024"></span>. Specifically to PPG
signals, previous research has also examined the effectiveness of using
multiple wavelengths to collect PPG data <span class="citation"
data-cites="ray_review_2023"></span>, however many studies rely on
constricting skin pigmentation categorization methods such as FST, which
constrains classification to a smaller range of skin tones <span
class="citation" data-cites="okoji_equity_2021"></span>. While such
efforts at aligning PPG quality and skin classification are
well-intentioned, historical skin classification systems such as the FST
are prone to subjectivity and bias, often struggling to classify based
on naked-eye observation and self-reporting alone <span class="citation"
data-cites="fitzpatrick_validity_1988"></span>. Our work aims to combine
the spirit of previous studies insofar as testing the effectiveness of
PPG reading on different skin pigmentations with colorimetry as
supported through the CIELAB color space.</p>
<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<p>Our study aims to investigate the effect of PPG signal quality and
accuracy across different skin tones. We recruited participants with
diverse skin tones, measured their pigmentation using CIELAB values, and
collected PPG signals under controlled conditions using multiple
wavelengths and combinations. Signal quality was evaluated using
statistical metrics, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), entropy, and
a heart rate deviation score, to determine the impact of skin tone on
PPG accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="device">Device</h2>
<p>We use ExtHub, a wearable bluetooth device that can be strapped on to
the forearms or upper arms. The device features a three axis
accelerometer, five light emitting diodes (LEDs) as photoplethysmography
(PPG) sensors, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor. For this study, we
only use the PPG sensors, which can be customized by frequency,
integration cycles, sequence repeats, and the gains of two
transimpedance amplifier channels. The device has the option to change
the light wavelengths used during the measurement period. The
wavelengths include, green, orange, red, and infrared, and the
electrical current for each wavelength can be changed from the range of
0 to 250 milliamperes (mAs). For our study, we strap on the ExtHub
sensors to the anterior forearm, with the placement of the sensor
approximately in the middle of the wrist and elbow. We also use a
constant sampling frequency of 50 hertz (Hz), 1 integration cycle, 16
sequence repeats, and gains of 20 thousand Ohms for both channels.</p>
<h2 id="participants-and-data-collection-procedure">Participants and
Data Collection Procedure</h2>
<p>Our study was conducted with 15 adult participants. We aim to recruit
participants of different skin tones to provide a diverse cohort because
the general goal of the study is to determine which wavelengths provide
quality PPG signals for people of various skin tones. We first prompted
participants to self-select the closest option to their anterior
forearm’s skin tone based on an eleven color palette. Then to obtain a
quantitative measurement of skin tone, we photographed the participants’
anterior forearms and used the Trigit web application <span
class="citation" data-cites="tjandra_trigit_2023"></span> to determine
the lightness (L*), red/green (a*), and yellow/blue (b*) values of the
CIELAB color space. To minimize random error, we performed three
repeated measurements of skin tone with three images of the
participants’ anterior forearms and averaged the three values. We
collected data in a well lit and windowless room to ensure lighting
changes did not impact the CIELAB calculation and PPG signal collection.
During the data collection period, each participant was instructed to
stay seated and to refrain from moving the arm that wore the ExtHub
device. We recorded PPG signals using red, green, orange, and infrared
wavelengths separately for 30 seconds each with a fixed electrical
current of 100 mA. Additionally, we recorded combinations of
wavelengths, including only visible light (red, green, orange), green
and infrared, and green and red wavelengths.</p>

<figcaption>X-axis: b* (Higher b* corresponds to greater yellow
component). Y-axis: L* (Higher L* corresponds to greater perceptual
lightness. Dashed lines are separators for skin pigmentation

</figure>
<p>To visualize the distribution of skin pigmentation for our
participants and group similar skin tones together, we used the
Individual Topology Angle (ITA), which uses L* and b* values to
correspond skin color to one of six groups <span class="citation"
data-cites="ly_research_2020"></span>. <a href="#fig:skincolor"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:skincolor">1</a> shows the
spread of associated skin tone for the participants.</p>
<h2 id="preprocessing">Preprocessing</h2>
<p>In order to retain the features of good and bad quality PPG signals,
we applied minimal preprocessing steps to our raw data. The raw signals
for green, red, and orange wavelengths are segmented into 20 second
non-overlapping intervals. For the green and red, green and infrared,
and visible light combinations, we align the separate wavelengths onto
the same time axis with cubic interpolation, normalize the magnitude of
the signals using the alternating and direct currents, and taking the
average of the respective signals to achieve the respective
combination.</p>
<h2 id="signal-quality-assessment">Signal Quality Assessment</h2>
<p>The signal metrics we evaluated are Signal Noise Ratio (SNR),
Kurtosis, Shannon Entropy (SE), and a heart rate variability score. We
selected these metrics because PPG signals are primarily used to measure
heart rate. To accurately measure heart rate, a high-quality signal
should exhibit consistent pulse waves with a distinct pulse peak.</p>
<p>We calculate SNR with respect to the signal power and noise power. To
determine a noisy signal, we apply a Butterworth band pass filter with
lower and upper thresholds of 0.7 and 3.5 on the raw signal and
calculate the difference between the filtered signal and the raw signal.
Kurtosis is calculated using Pearson’s definition. The probability
distribution function needed for SE is calculated by creating a
histogram of 10 bins to find the probability distribution of the signal,
then entropy is calculated with the probability distribution function.
The heart rate variability score is a score that determines how much the
estimated heart rate for one wavelength type varies compared to the
average heart rate for the participant, with 0 signifying an estimated
heart rate further away from the average and 1 signifying an estimated
heart rate with the same value as the average. To determine the
estimated heart rate, we use the HeartPy library and extract the beats
per minute from the processed signal <span class="citation"
data-cites="gent_analysing_2018"></span>. Average heart rate is recorded
by averaging the estimated heart rates across all wavelengths for each
participant. We calculate a penalty score that represents how much each
estimated heart rate deviates from the average heart rate. We observe
some flatlining PPG signals, notably in the infrared and red
wavelengths. The metrics for these signals are null values.</p>
<p>Signal quality is determined as a binary indicator, with 0 indicating
a bad signal and 1 indicating a good signal. Given the previously
calculated metrics, we assign a threshold to each metric: the
signal-to-noise ratio must be greater than 0, which indicates the signal
is stronger than the relative noise; the kurtosis is be less than or
equal to 3.5, which was determined as a suitable threshold in previous
literature <span class="citation"
data-cites="selvaraj_statistical_2011"></span>; the entropy must be
greater than or equal to 0.8, also following previous literature <span
class="citation" data-cites="selvaraj_statistical_2011"></span>; and the
penalty score must be greater than or equal to 0.67, which corresponds
to being within one standard deviation of the mean average heart rate.
To classify a signal as good, at least three out of the four conditions
must be met, otherwise the signal is classified as bad. For null value
metrics, we automatically classify the signal as a bad signal.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>

<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>Our results suggest that the wavelength type used in
photoplethysmography (PPG) significantly influences signal quality,
while skin pigmentation shows minimal correlation with signal quality
across various metrics. This finding contrasts with existing literature,
which has often reported a noticeable impact of skin pigmentation on
pulse oximetry accuracy and optical properties relevant to medical
technologies <span class="citation"
data-cites="al-halawani_review_2023"></span><span class="citation"
data-cites="setchfield_effect_2024"></span>. While this difference could
be due to many factors, we want to stress the high variability exhibited
by PPG devices, as also reported by Bent, et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bent_investigating_2020"></span>. </p>
<p>The analysis clearly shows distinct variations in PPG quality among
wavelength types. Specifically, wavelength combinations involving
visible light—particularly the "Green and Red" and "Visible Light"
combinations—yielded consistently higher quality signals compared to
infrared wavelengths. The poor performance observed in infrared
wavelengths primarily resulted from flatlined signals, indicating
practical limitations in utilizing infrared alone for reliable PPG
measurements at rest. This observation contrasts somewhat with previous
literature that has broadly supported infrared for deep tissue
penetration and low interference [4] [9]. However, our findings
underscore the practical limitations and variability of infrared-based
readings in certain contexts, possibly due to differences in
environmental control, measurement setups, or the specific infrared
wavelengths and sensor configurations used.</p>
<p>The minimal correlation between skin pigmentation and signal quality
metrics suggests that, while skin pigmentation could theoretically
affect optical properties, we did not establish a strong correlation in
our findings under controlled environmental conditions. Our utilization
of precise colorimetry tools like CIELab, as opposed to subjective
scales, contributes robustness to our observations and addresses
methodological gaps in previous research, where subjective assessments
may have contributed to variability and inconclusive results
[10][11].</p>
<p>Our study contributes to the ongoing conversation regarding the
relationship between skin pigmentation and PPG signal quality by
providing empirical data from controlled laboratory conditions and
precise measurement methods. The insights derived here resonate with
recent recommendations advocating for standardized and objective
measurement approaches in skin pigmentation assessment [5].</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>One key limitation of our study was the relatively small sample size,
which may have contributed to the high variability observed in the PPG
quality scores. This variability likely influenced our inability to find
statistically significant correlations between skin pigmentation and PPG
signal quality metrics. Future research should incorporate a larger,
more diverse participant sample to enhance statistical power and
reliability of conclusions.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the CIELab measurement technique provided
objective data on skin pigmentation, it has inherent limitations, such
as sensitivity to lighting conditions and measurement angles.
Incorporating more precise and specialized melonometry tools, as
suggested by Vasudevan et al. <span class="citation"
data-cites="vasudevan_melanometry_2024"></span>, could improve the
accuracy and consistency of skin pigmentation measurements in subsequent
studies, thus potentially clarifying any existing relationships between
skin pigmentation and PPG signal quality.</p>
